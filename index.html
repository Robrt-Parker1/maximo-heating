  <!-- Image Section -->
  <div class="container image-section">
    <img src="https://media.istockphoto.com/id/1061727682/photo/a-leaking-faucet-on-a-domestic-water-heater-with-tools-and-fittings-to-replace-appliance.jpg?s=612x612&w=0&k=20&c=1dfwK8I75B08Pku4pNpDuEz8W62vrsNRoSwVNDqIUNk="/>
  </div>

  <!-- Leaky Faucets Section -->
  <div class="container section">
    <h2>Leaky Faucets</h2>
    <p>Leaky faucets are among the most prevalent plumbing problems encountered in homes today. Even a slow drip can result in a significant waste of water over time. Typically, this issue stems from worn-out washers or seals inside the faucet, although corrosion or improper installation can also be culprits. While some homeowners may attempt a DIY fix, consulting a licensed professional ensures the problem is addressed thoroughly and permanently. A skilled technician can replace the affected parts or recommend faucet upgrades that align with your home's current plumbing system.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Clogged Drains Section -->
  <div class="container section">
    <h2>Clogged Drains</h2>
    <p>Another common plumbing headache is clogged drains, often found in sinks, tubs, and showers. In the kitchen, clogs usually result from grease buildup, food particles, and soap scum, while bathroom clogs often include hair and personal care products. While store-bought drain cleaners may offer temporary relief, they often contain harsh chemicals that damage pipes over time. Professional plumbing solutions in Clifton NJ utilize safe, effective methods such as hydro jetting or mechanical snakes to clear blockages and restore proper drainage.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Running Toilets Section -->
  <div class="container section">
    <h2>Running Toilets</h2>
    <p>A toilet that runs continuously can waste hundreds of gallons of water a day and significantly inflate your utility bill. In most cases, this issue is caused by a faulty flapper valve that fails to seal properly, though it can also be related to a broken float mechanism or misaligned fill tube. Fixing a running toilet often involves replacing inexpensive parts, but if the problem persists, a professional plumbing repair in Clifton NJ may be necessary to prevent further water loss and ensure long-term functionality.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Low Water Pressure Section -->
  <div class="container section">
    <h2>Low Water Pressure</h2>
    <p>Low water pressure can affect every fixture in your home, turning daily tasks like showering or washing dishes into a hassle. The causes of low pressure are varied, ranging from sediment buildup in pipes and faulty pressure regulators to hidden leaks or corrosion in older plumbing systems. Diagnosing the issue can be challenging without the right tools, which is why many homeowners turn to a qualified plumbing company in Clifton NJ for help. Experts can evaluate the entire system and offer solutions that restore optimal water flow.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Dripping Pipes Section -->
  <div class="container section">
    <h2>Dripping Pipes</h2>
    <p>Dripping pipes are not just an annoyance—they can lead to water damage, mold growth, and increased utility bills. These leaks can occur in both visible and hidden areas of your plumbing system. While they might start as minor issues, over time they can compromise structural elements in your home. Causes may include joint deterioration, excessive water pressure, or even tree root intrusion. Swift action from experienced professionals offering plumbing solutions in Clifton NJ can prevent the damage from spreading and keep your home safe.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Water Heater Problems Section -->
  <div class="container section">
    <h2>Water Heater Problems</h2>
    <p>When your water heater stops working properly, it can interrupt your entire household routine. Issues such as no hot water, discolored water, and unusual noises typically indicate sediment buildup, thermostat malfunction, or worn-out components. Routine maintenance can extend the life of your unit, but if performance issues persist, it might be time for a replacement. A certified plumbing company in Clifton NJ can help determine whether repairs are sufficient or if upgrading to a more efficient model is the better choice.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Sewer Backups Section -->
  <div class="container section">
    <h2>Sewer Backups</h2>
    <p>Sewer system backups are among the most serious plumbing emergencies. Warning signs include foul odors, multiple drain clogs, and water backing up into tubs or sinks. These problems are often caused by tree roots, collapsed pipes, or blockages in the main sewer line. Immediate intervention is necessary to avoid health hazards and structural damage. An experienced team that specializes in plumbing repair in Clifton NJ will use advanced diagnostic tools to locate the blockage and provide effective long-term solutions.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Faulty Sump Pumps Section -->
  <div class="container section">
    <h2>Faulty Sump Pumps</h2>
    <p>Sump pumps play a crucial role in preventing basement flooding by directing water away from the foundation of your home. When they fail, the consequences can be disastrous. Common causes of failure include power outages, clogged discharge lines, or a malfunctioning float switch. Regular testing and maintenance can prevent unexpected breakdowns. In case of failure, replacement and inspection by professionals in plumbing solutions in Clifton NJ will ensure the new system operates reliably during heavy rain or snowmelt.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Kitchen Plumbing Issues Section -->
  <div class="container section">
    <h2>Kitchen Plumbing Issues</h2>
    <p>The kitchen is one of the most used areas in the home, and plumbing problems here can quickly disrupt daily life. Leaking dishwashers, clogged sinks, or faulty garbage disposals are frequent complaints. Over time, grease and food waste can lead to significant pipe buildup or even damage to the garbage disposal unit. Professional services specializing in kitchen plumbing in Clifton NJ can offer targeted solutions that restore convenience and functionality, while also providing tips on how to prevent future problems through proper usage and maintenance.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Pipe Corrosion and Aging Infrastructure Section -->
  <div class="container section">
    <h2>Pipe Corrosion and Aging Infrastructure</h2>
    <p>Many homes in older neighborhoods have aging plumbing systems made of galvanized steel or cast iron, both of which are prone to corrosion over time. Signs of pipe corrosion include discolored water, frequent leaks, and a noticeable metallic taste in tap water. Replacing old pipes can be a major project, but it's one that pays off in terms of improved water quality and fewer repairs. A knowledgeable plumbing company in Clifton NJ can inspect your system and recommend appropriate upgrades, often replacing problematic materials with modern, long-lasting alternatives like PEX or copper.</p>
  </div>
